# Creating Theatre Archives

## Best Practices

Best practices and resources for documenting theatre and dance

- *Use metadata standards*. Metadata standards are vital to ensure that materials in an archive can be easily found. They also help design a plan for migrating records when storage technologies and user interfaces change. At the very minimum, you should include [Dublin Core](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/metadata-standards/dublin-core) metadata (more about how to do this below). 
- Have a sustainability pathway. Uploading material to a website is a good way to ensure that many people have access to a collection. But what will happen to it in 10 or 50 years from now? We recommend uploading
- Include explicit descriptions of how the collections where made
- Make sure you have intellectual property rights
- Enable a multiplicity of uses
