# Creating Theatre Archives

## Best Practices

Best practices and resources for documenting theatre and dance

- <img src="images/metadata.svg" style="height:20px"/> **Use metadata standards**. Metadata standards are vital to ensure that materials in an archive can be easily found. They also help design a plan for migrating records when storage technologies and user interfaces change. At the very minimum, you should include [Dublin Core](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/metadata-standards/dublin-core) metadata (more about how to do this below).
-  <img src="images/sustainable.svg" style="height:20px"/> **Develop a sustainability pathway**. Uploading material to a website is a good way to ensure that many people have access to a collection. But what will happen to it in 10 or 50 years from now? Below we offer a list of places that are *reasonably* stable for your collections. But a more robust sustainability strategy would probably mean partnering with a university or national archive so that in due course the collections can be managed within a *custodial setting* (that is, an institution with the manpower and technical expertise to keep the records perpetually).
-  <img src="images/explicit.svg" style="height:20px"/> **Include explicit descriptions of how the collections where made**. Make sure that all relevant information about how records where selected, what things are excluded and how the records were made is explicit in the site. No archive can be fully neutral and it is important for users of the archive to understand the perspective of the peopl who made the archives and put the records together.
-  <img src="images/ip.svg" style="height:20px"/> **Obtain intellectual property rights**. Make sure that you acquire the rights to the documents in the archive and that the performers (and other holders of the property rights) agree to deposit their material in the archive. There are many ways to enable the materials in the archive to be reused and this must also be explictely communicated in the archive.
-  <img src="images/multiple.svg" style="height:20px"/> **Enable a multiplicity of uses**. Useful archives need to be used by many people for many different purposes. Think of making archives that don't priviledge a particular interpretation but favor a multiplicity of perspectives.
